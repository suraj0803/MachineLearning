Bagging : The term bagging is also known as bootstrap aggregation. 
          In bagging methods, ensemble model tries to improve prediction accuracy and decrease model
           variance by combining predictions of individual models trained over randomly generated
            training samples.The final prediction of ensemble model will be given by calculating 
            the average of all predictions from the individual estimators. 
            One of the best examples of bagging methods are random forests.
